          portion of the exam contains <span class="important">problems similar to those you did in your PyCharm projects.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          For Exam 1, your repository contains a <span class="important">sample On-the-Computer exam</span>
          in the project named <span class="important">06b-Sample_Exam1-Optional.</span>

          <span class="important">AFTER you complete the Paper-and-Pencil part</span> of the exam:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Open PyCharm and do <span class="important">VCS ~ Update</span>
            to obtain the exam (if it is not already present).
          </li>
          <li>
            Work through the TODOs in the modules,
            just as you have done in your previous PyCharm projects.

          If you have <span

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As a reminder:
            <span class="very_important_emphasis">ALWAYS work BY HAND any example that the problem supplies.</span>
            That helps you understand the specification AND suggests how to write the code!
          </li>
          <li> You may contact us by using Microsoft Teams, by email, or by telephone (your choice).</li>
          <li>
            <span class="very_important_emphasis">If you do not understand WHAT a problem is asking you to do,</span>
            <span class="important">contact us and ask us to help you understand the problem SPECIFICATION.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have technical problems of any sort (e.g. PyCharm stops working), contact us.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are ON YOUR OWN with regard to SOLVING the problems. In particular:
            <ul>
              <li>
                We will NOT offer any help on ANY error messages produced
                by running your program.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will NOT help you debug your code to figure out why it is failing test cases.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="important">
              You must NOT communicate with any person other than your instructor while taking the exam.

            </ul>

            It is OK to use books, handouts, or other written materials that you have gathered BEFORE the exam.
