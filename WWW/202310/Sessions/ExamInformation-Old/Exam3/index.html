      <p>
        For each exam in CSSE 120,
        <span class="emphasis">you MUST have completed all the practice problems,</span>
        both paper-and-pencil and on-the-computer,
        to your instructor's satisfaction,
        <span class="critical">BEFORE you take the exam.</span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          That is, completing those practice problems are your <span class="critical">Admission Ticket</span>
          for taking the exam.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span class="emphasis">For Exam 3,</span> the practice problems are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The <span class="emphasis">20-Exam3Practice</span> project in PyCharm.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a href="../Exam3/Test3_PracticeForPaperAndPencilProblems.pdf">
          Paper-and-Pencil Practice Problems for Exam 3</a>,
          including checking your answers via this
          <a href="../Exam3/Test3_SOLUTION_PracticeForPaperAndPencilProblems.pdf">
            Answer Key</a> for those problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          The following problems from the <a
            href="../Exam2/Exam2_PracticeForPaperAndPencilProblems.pdf">
          Paper-and-Pencil Practice Problems for Exam 2</a>,
          including checking your answers via this
          <a href="../Exam2/Exam2_SOLUTION_PracticeForPaperAndPencilProblems.pdf">
            Answer Key</a> for those problems.
          <ul>
            <li>
              [13 - 16, 24 - 32, 38, 39] References and related concepts.
            </li>
            <li>
              [30 - 32, 38, 39] Box and Pointer diagrams.
            </li>
            <li>
              [27 - 29, 33 - 35] Mutation of a list / object by a function.
            </li>
            <li>
              [10 - 12, 34, 35] Fact that tuples and strings are immutable. What that means.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
        <p>
          Do a page of problems, and THEN check your answers for that page.
          The answer key follows the same page-by-page as the problems.
          Of course, check each page <span class="critical">AFTER (!)</span> doing each
          page. To do otherwise would only harm your learning.
        </p>
      <p>
        You <span class="emphasis">demonstrate</span> that you have completed the practice problems by
        submitting your solutions to Moodle in the usual way
        (in Session 14).
      </p>
      <p>
        As <strong><em>additional</em> preparation for the exam,</strong> you should do the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Read this <a href="Exam3_AcademicIntegrity.pdf">Academic Integrity statement.</a>
          You will sign a copy of that document at the end of the exam.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read this list of
          <a href="Exam1_QuestionsStudentsFrequently.pdf">frequently asked questions (with answers)</a>
          for Exam 1 (it applies to Exam 3 as well).
          <ul>
            <li>
              It contains questions that students have, in the past,
              wished they had understood answers to BEFORE taking Exam 3.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may refer to this document while doing the On-the-Computer part of the exam.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Neither of the above two items form part of your Admission Ticket,
        but you would be wise to have read both BEFORE taking the exam.
      </p>

      Two parts: <span class="distinguish-from-surrounding-padded">Paper-and-Pencil</span>
      and <span class="distinguish-from-surrounding-padded">On-the-Computer</span>
    </div>
    <div class=" body newspaper">
      <p>
        These are the <span class="emphasis">same rules as those for Exams 1 and 2.</span>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Time limit:</span>
            You have <span class="emphasis"> 2 hours </span> to complete the exam (both parts),
            plus a <span class="emphasis"> 30-minute grace period.</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Communication:</span>
            For both parts of the exam, you must not communicate with anyone except your instructors
            and their assistants, if any. In particular:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="critical">During</span> the exam,
              <span class="emphasis">
                you must not talk with anyone else or exchange information with them during the exam.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="critical">After</span> the exam,
              <span class="emphasis">you must not talk about the exam with anyone who has not yet taken it.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="critical">During</span> the exam,
              <em>do NOT use email, chat or the like.</em>
              Close any such applications before beginning the exam.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class="emphasis"> Questions during the exam:</span>
            Throughout the exam, if you have a
            <span class="emphasis">question about WHAT we are asking you to do,</span>
            e.g. if you do not understand the specification of a function that you are to implement,
            <span class="emphasis">ask ANY of the instructors</span>
            to explain WHAT you are to do for the problem.
            (If a student assistant is proctoring your room, ask them to get an instructor.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="emphasis">You are on your own for solving the problems.</span>
            In particular
            <span class="critical">we will not answer any questions about error messages.</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">You are welcome to leave the room</span>
          to use the restroom, stretch your legs,
          go outside to get a break from your mask, or whatever.
          You do not need to ask permission to do so.
          But remember: <span class="emphasis"> Do NOT talk to ANYONE about ANYTHING when you do so.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Assistive devices:</span>
          You may use any assistive devices you normally use for taking
          exams, including but not limited to the following:
          <ul>
            <li> Dictionaries and/or translators.</li>
            <li> Hearing, vision and hand-writing assistive devices.</li>
            <li> Devices to address dyslexia.</li>
            <li> A calculator (but only for computing numeric values (no programming).</li>
            <li> Blank paper and/or blank post-it notes. (We'll bring some.)</li>
            <li>
              If your proctor permits it, you may listen to quiet music using
              headphones to the extent that it does not disturb other students.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">We want you to have a testing environment in which you are comfortable.</span>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Of course we will honor all accommodations (including extra time)
              for students that have obtained official letters stating so.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally,
              if you need a quieter or more secluded place to take the exam, or
              if there are other accommodations that help you be more
              effective in demonstrating your knowledge/understanding via this
              exam, do not hesitate to discuss them in advance with your
              instructor.
