            </p>
            <p>
                As <strong><em>additional</em> preparation for the exam,</strong> you should do the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Read this <a href="Exam1_AcademicIntegrity.pdf">Academic Integrity statement.</a>
                    You will sign a copy of that document at the end of the exam.

                <li>
                    Read this list of

                            It contains questions that students have, in the past,
                            wished they had understood answers to BEFORE taking Exam 1.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may refer to this document while doing the On-the-Computer part of the exam.

                Neither of the above two items form part of your Admission Ticket,
