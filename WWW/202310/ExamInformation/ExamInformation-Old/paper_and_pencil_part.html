        <p>
          <span class="important_emphasis">The Paper-and-Pencil</span>
          portion of the exam contains <span class="important">problems in which you:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="important">Trace code by hand.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Write <span class="important">short snippets of code</span> to do various things.
          </li>
          <li>
            Indicate <span class="important">what names (variables) are valid at what places,</span>
            thereby demonstrating your understanding of <span class="important">scope.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Write a <span class="important">short but complete implementation of a function</span>
            whose specification you are given.
          </li>
        </ul>
        plus possibly other problems similar to the above.
        <p>
          Here is a
          <a href="../../Resources/ExamPreparation/Exam1_Paper_and_Pencil_SAMPLE_EXAM.pdf">sample of the
            paper-and-pencil portion</a> of Exam 1.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          PRIOR to taking the exam,
          you should prepare a <span class="important">Hint Sheet</span>
          with whatever you want on it, typed or handwritten or a combination of the two,
          subject to the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For Exam 1:  You may use only ONE side of ONE 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper.
            For Exams 2 and 3:  You may use TWO such sheets of paper.
          </li>
          <li> You must have prepared the Hint Sheet before beginning the exam.</li>
          <li>
            It is best if you create your own sheet (working with someone else is fine)
            as that will probably maximize both your learning and your score on the exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you lack access to a printer,
            you may create an electronic document that is the equivalent of the above sheet(s) of paper
            and you may access that document while taking the exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Hint Sheet will be the ONLY external source of information
            that you may use while taking the Paper-and-Pencil part of the exam.
          </li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To <span class="important">TAKE the Paper-and-Pencil part</span> of the exam, you will:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li> Get onto your computer, connected to the Internet. (If this is difficult for you, contact us.)</li>
          <li>
            Enter Moodle and enter the session/topic named for the exam:
            <span class="important_emphasis">Session 7 for Exam 1</span>,
            or <span class="important_emphasis">Session 16 for Exam 2</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="important">Read the document</span> named
            <span class="important_emphasis">Paper-and-Pencil part.</span>
            <ul>
              <li> It will be a PDF with the statements of the problems.</li>
              <li> You may print the document if you wish, but you do not have to do so.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
