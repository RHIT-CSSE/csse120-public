          </li>
          <li>
            Submit the <span class="important">On-the-Computer</span>
            part of the exam in the same way that you submit your other PyCharm projects:
            <ul>
              <li> First, do <span class="important">VCS ~ Commit</span> and select
                <span class="important">Commit-and-Push</span>, as
                usual.
                <ul>
                  <li> Do this frequently &mdash; that way, if your computer dies you won't lose any work!</li>
                  <li> Be sure to do a <span class="important">Commit-and-Push</span> at the end.</li>
                  <li>
                    You can do <span class="important">VCS ~ Git ~ Push</span>
                    (way at the bottom of the pop-up menu) just to be sure that you pushed, if you like.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Second, turn in your code to Moodle, in the section (topic) for the Exam
                that is labelled <em>Turn in your Code from your PyCharm exam project here.</em>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Selecting that item will bring up a place where you can drag and drop your modules into
                    Moodle.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Drag and drop ALL the modules in the <span class="important">src</span>
                    folder for the session, but JUST those modules.
                  </li>
                  <li> Include the modules like rosegraphics.</li>
                  <li>
                    Do NOT zip the folder -- just drag and drop the FILES in the
                    <span class="important">src</span> folder.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                The <em>Turn in your Code from your PyCharm exam project here</em> item
                also asks you some self-reflection questions.
