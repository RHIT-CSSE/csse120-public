READING
Conditionals: IF and IF-ELSE and IF-ELIF-ELIF...ELSE statements
../../../VideoFiles/04.1-Conditionals/Conditionals.pdf
<span class="emphasis">
This and all the succeeding items in this Videos/Reading section
have a quiz associated with them on Moodle.
</span>

The above PDF was constructed from portions of
<a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/conditionals.html">
<span class="emphasis">Chapter 5. Conditionals,</span></a>
which itself is part of
<a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/">
<em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3</em></a>
by Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers.

The book is a nice online resource, as are the other books from
the <a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/">Open Book Project</a>.

VIDEO
The Accumulator Pattern (revisited)
../../../VideoFiles/06.1-TheAccumulatorPattern-Part2/TheAccumulatorPattern.mp4
9:36
This video extends the accumulator pattern from the <em>summing</em> pattern that
you have seen previously
to include the <em>counting</em> and <em>in-graphics</em> accumulator patterns.

The video uses a graphics system call Zellegraphics that preceded
RoseGraphics, so you will see <em>zg</em> instead of <em>rg</em>
and other such small changes from what we use now.

VIDEO
First Do a Concrete Example By Hand
../../../VideoFiles/04.7-FirstDoAConcreteExampleByHand/FirstDoAConcreteExampleByHand.mp4
10:39
In almost ANY non-trivial software development coding problem,
you simply MUST <span class="emphasis">do a concrete example by hand,</span>
as shown in this video.

Note: The video uses the following example: Given a line, draw a diamond from the line.
The video <em>should</em> have said that the given line is the
<span class="emphasis">upper-left</span> line of the diamond.
Instead, the video wrongly spoke of "positive slope".
