Note

You might prefer to do some or all of these Follow-Me videos <span class="emphasis">in class</span>
so that you can ask questions as desired during them.

Improving your <span class="technical-name">debugging skills</span> is critical for your success
on Exam 1.  These Follow-Me videos help you do that.

When the video asks you to pause the video, do something (per the video) in PyCharm,
and then resume the video,
<span class="emphasis">be sure that you really do PAUSE the video,
DO what the video asks you to try, and only then RESUME the video.</span>
