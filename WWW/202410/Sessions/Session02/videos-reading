VIDEO
Getting started in Python - Numbers, Arithmetic Operators, \
Expressions, Objects, Types, Names, and Assignment (whew!)
https://youtu.be/iExTqLdVBVE
49:42
This video <span class="emphasis">and all the other videos in this section</span>
have an associated quiz in Moodle.

While you watch this video, you will complete the
<span class="emphasis">m1_expressions</span> module of the
<span class="emphasis">02-ObjectsFunctionsAndMethods</span> project
in PyCharm.  Watch the beginning of the video for details.

This video introduces a lot of ideas, almost all of which will be so natural
to you that you hardly need to be told it.  As you watch the video and do
the accompanying work in PyCharm, <span class="emphasis">make notes to yourself</span>
on things that you think you might not remember until you have practiced them more.
Over the next few sessions, you will get LOTS of practice on ALL of the ideas
in this video.

In making this video, we spoke and typed slowly, so that you could keep up with the video.
For some of you, it may be TOO slow; if so, watch it at 1.5 (or even double) speed,
using the settings that YouTube provides in most browsers.
