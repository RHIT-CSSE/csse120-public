            </p>
            <p>
                As <strong><em>additional</em> preparation for the exam,</strong> you should do the following:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Read this <a href="Exam1_AcademicIntegrity.pdf">Academic Integrity statement.</a>
                    You will sign a copy of that document at the end of the exam.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Read this list of

                            It contains questions that students have, in the past,
                            wished they had understood answers to BEFORE taking Exam 1.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may refer to this document while doing the On-the-Computer part of the exam.

                        Your Hint Sheet must be a single 8.5 x 11-inch sheet of paper,
                        with whatever you want on it, typed or handwritten or a combination of the two.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You must have prepared your Hint Sheet before beginning the exam.

                    <li>
                        It is best if you create your own sheet (working with someone else is fine)
                        as that will probably maximize both your learning and your score on the exam.
