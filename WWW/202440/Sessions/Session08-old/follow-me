The video indicates that the project is <span class="emphasis">08</span>-Implementing Classes,
but in fact it is <span class="emphasis">09</span>-ImplementingClasses.

It is best to do this Follow-Me video BEFORE class,
since that makes the most effective use of your time.
But as always with Follow-Me videos,
you may do them in-class.  It just means that you will have more to do AFTER class
than you would otherwise.

    we <span class="emphasis">strongly</span> recommend that you do this Follow-Me video BEFORE class.
