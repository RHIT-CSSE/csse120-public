        For most problems,
        <span class="important_emphasis">if you are still working on the problem after 5 (or at most 10)
                minutes</span> on that problem:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="important_emphasis">STOP working on that problem.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue to the next problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Ask for help </strong> on the problem(s) that you did not complete.
          <ul>
            <li>
              One way to do that is via the <span class="very_important">Live Now!</span>

    <p>
      There are no quizzes in Moodle for this session.
      But <span class="important">there ARE things to do for this session,</span> as listed below.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: red; text-align: left">Videos and Reading: </h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="very_important_emphasis">Before</span>
          <span class="important">doing the paper-and-pencil practice problems for Exam 2</span>
          (that you will see below),
          <span class="important">do this <a href="../Quizzes/Quiz14.pdf"> Before-the-Session quiz</a>.</span>
          (But read the sub-items below first.)
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This quiz includes practice problems for the paper-and-pencil part of Exam 2
            that are very similar in form to problems that you might actually see on Exam 2.
          </li>
          <li>
            You do not have to print the quiz (unless you want to). Just hand-write your answers on
            paper or type your answers into a file, whichever is easier for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may have questions or uncertainty about some of the problems as you do them.
            That is OK! Just take your best guess and continue to the next problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            AFTER attempting all the problems, you will watch videos with their solutions.
            But to get the full benefit of the problems, it is critical that you
            <span class="important">attempt the problems before continuing to their solutions</span> (below).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Get help from your instructor and/or student assistants if you have some solutions that you do NOT

          <li>
            <span class="important_emphasis">If you are still working on Sessions 8 through 10</span>

            to get help catching up before Exam 2.

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
