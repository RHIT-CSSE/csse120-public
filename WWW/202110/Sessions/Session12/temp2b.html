            In the previous session's Preparation, you watched the first 9 or so minutes
          of this
              <a
                  href="../../../VideoFiles/11.3-PatternsForIteratingThroughSequences/Video/PatternsForIteratingThroughSequences/PatternsForIteratingThroughSequences.mp4">
                video on Patterns for Iterating Through Sequences</a> [15:21 minutes].
              <span class="required">Now watch the ENTIRE video, paying especially close attention to the portion that
          starts at the 9:00 minute mark.</span>

          Be sure to understand:
          <ul>
            <li> The 3 basic ways to iterate through a loop.</li>
            <li> The FIND pattern.</li>
            <li> The two-places-at-once pattern.</li>
            <li> The parallel-sequences pattern.
            <li> The MAX/MIN pattern.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong><em>After</em></strong> doing the above, but <strong><em>before</em></strong> doing the
        in-class project (in PyCharm):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Do this <a href="../Quizzes/Quiz12.pdf"> before-the-session quiz</a>.</li>
        <li>
          You do not have to print the quiz (unless you want to). Just hand-write your answers on
          paper or type your answers into a file, whichever is easier for you.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        When you are ready to <strong><em>begin the in-class project (in PyCharm):</em></strong>
