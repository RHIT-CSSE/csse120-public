      in these Before-the-Session videos.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          To that end, we recommend that you watch these videos and do the coding
          from the &ldquo;Follow-Me&rdquo; videos
          <span class="important_emphasis">when a meeting is open in the Live Now! channel</span>
          of the CSSE 120 group in Microsoft Teams.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          That way you can get INSTANT answers to your questions BEFORE you apply the concepts
          in the other modules in PyCharm.

        Session 5 has TWO projects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class="very_important_emphasis">05a-Debugging:</span>
            These are exercises that not only improve your debugging skills,
            but also specifically address the debugging challenges that most often impede
            students' progress on Exam 1. To make the most effective use of 05a-Debugging:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Do the entire project while watching its &ldquo;Follow-Me&rdquo; video below.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each TODO, try to debug the error(s) associate with that TODO yourself
              BEFORE watching its solution.
            </li>
            <li>
              However,
              <span
                  class="very_important_emphasis">do NOT spend more than a few minutes on any TODO in these modules.</span>
              Once you are no longer making effective progress in debugging (e.g., if you start GUESSING at the fixes),
              play the portion of the video that shows the solution.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class="very_important_emphasis">05b-Exam1Practice:</span>
            These are TERRIFIC exercises to prepare you for the on-the-computer part of Exam 1.
            To make the most effective use of 05b-Exam1Practice:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Do the <span class="very_important_emphasis">problem1</span> module while watching
              its &ldquo;Follow-Me&rdquo; video below.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each of the exercises in the remaining modules has a TIME and DIFFICULTY rating.
              See details at the top of each module. The key is:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you reach the TIME limit/rating for the problem while working on it,
                  and if you are not just a minute or two from a solution,
                  STOP working on that problem and GET HELP in doing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  That is because if you reach the TIME limit/rating for the problem,
                  you are probably missing some CONCEPT that is easily explained
                  but NOT easily figured out without help.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span class="very_important_black">
          Always remember that your goal is to UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS in the exercise,
          not merely to just get it to pass test cases.
        </span>

        <span class="important">Problems 8 - 10</span> in the Before-the-Session quiz are TERRIFIC practice for the Paper-and-Pencil portion of Exam 1.
        <span class="important_emphasis">Be SURE that you understand their solutions, as presented in the above videos.</span>
      </p>


      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Of course, do that <a href="../../Quizzes/Quiz05.pdf">Before-the-Session quiz</a>
            BEFORE you watch this video that reviews its answers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check your own answers carefully, marking all that are wrong (for your own sake, not for grading

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you wrote your answers by hand, take a photo of your answers.

        <li>
          <p>
            <span class="very_important_emphasis">Submit</span>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Watch the &ldquo;Follow-Me&rdquo; videos listed below.
        As you watch each video:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class="important">Do the coding in PyCharm,</span>
            following what you see on the video.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You can do the coding as the video does it or by reviewing the video afterwards (your choice).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The key is to <span class="important_emphasis">UNDERSTAND</span>
            what you are coding, not merely type what the video shows.
