    Session 21 is an <span class="optional">optional</span> class.
    <span class="important">Come to class if you want to do either of the following:</span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask questions and get help on any of the material we have covered, including but not limited to
      Session19-Exam3Practice and the practice Paper-and-Pencil problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="very_important">Take Exam 2b per the rules announced via email:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Exam 2b is an OPTIONAL opportunity for you to improve your Exam 2 paper-and-pencil score.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exam 2b will have a set of problems that mirror the paper-and-pencil problems on Exam 2,
          in the same order that they appeared on Exam 2.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may re-attempt UP TO 3 problems. (This prevents students from just attempting the whole thing without
          learning the concepts).
        </li>
        <li>
          Your final score on each problem that you attempt will be the AVERAGE of your scores on that problem from
          Exams 2 and 2b.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prior to taking Exam 2b, you must:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Determine which problem numbers you intend to take on Exam 2b, and bring that list to Exam 2b.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make a sincere effort BEFORE taking Exam2b to learn how to do each problem that you intend to take on Exam
              2b.
              (At the least, determine and understand the correct answer to the corresponding Exam 2 question.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>
          Exam 2b has the same rules as Exam 2, <span class="important">including its optional “hint sheet”.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no “double jeopardy.” That is, if your score on the Exam 2b problem is lower than your score on the
          corresponding Exam 2 problem, your final score on that problem will be your Exam 2 score (not the average of
          Exam 2 and Exam 2b).
        </li>
        <li>
          There are practice problems (handed out in class) to help you prepare for Exam 2b.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
