    <li>
      [Sections 1 and 2] Do the <span class="required">Peer Evaluation for Sprint 1 (on Moodle)</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="required">Sprint 1 Review:</span> Do whatever your instructor asked you to do (if anything) to review
      Sprint 1.
      <p>
        For Sections 1 and 2 this means to do the following for each Card
        in your Sprint 1 List on your team's Trello Board:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the Card's Feature is complete (or otherwise at a stopping point),
          have a teammate run the program to test your
          implementation of the Feature.
          If the teammate deems that the Feature is working correctly,
          change the Card's status to <em>Verified by a Peer</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Card's Feature is complete (or otherwise at a stopping point),
          have a teammate do a brief Code Review of your implementation of that Feature.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Card's Feature is <em>NOT</em> complete,
          make a copy of the Card,
          putting the copy in Sprint 2 (or Sprint 3 if you will not continue work on the feature until then).
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you have done the above for the Sprint 1 Card,
          <span class="required">add a Blue stripe to the Card's status</span> to indicate that you have completed
          your Sprint 1 Review with regard to that Card.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="required">Sprint 2 Planning:</span> Do whatever your instructor asked you to do to plan for Sprint 2.
      <p>
        For Sections 1 and 2 this means that you
        should:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Determine which Features you expect to complete during Sprint 2.
          (Coordinate with teammates in making these choices.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a Card for each such Feature,
          by dragging (or copying, your choice) the Card from the Product Backlog List
          to the Sprint 2 List.
        </li>
        <li>
          For whichever Feature you will work on first,
          use the Checklist on its Card to list the three or so steps
          by which you will implement that Feature.
          Each step should be testable.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Continue to <span class="required">work on your project</span>,
      being sure to <span class="required">record ALL the hours that you work on the project</span>
      in your <em>hours-X.txt</em> file.
    </li>
  </ol>
