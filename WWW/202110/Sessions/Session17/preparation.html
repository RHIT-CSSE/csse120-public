        PRINTING</a>
        [7:11 minutes]
        is for the &ldquo;live coding&rdquo; that your instructor may do with you IN CLASS.
        (Sorry about the poor quality of the video.)
        It will be most useful to you if you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Do the coding AS YOU WATCH THE VIDEO.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do NOT watch it now, since you do not yet have the project with the problems.
          (Although you may watch it now, if you wish.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Wait for class. Your instructor may or may not have you watch this video then.
