Conditionals: IF and IF-ELSE and IF-ELIF-ELIF...ELSE statements
../../../VideoFiles/04.1-Conditionals/Conditionals.pdf
<span class="emphasis">
This and all the succeeding items in this Videos/Reading section
have a quiz associated with them on Moodle.
</span>

The above PDF was constructed from portions of
<a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/conditionals.html">
<span class="emphasis">Chapter 5. Conditionals,</span></a>
which itself is part of
<a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/">
<em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3</em></a>
by Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers.

The book is a nice online resource, as are the other books from
the <a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/">Open Book Project</a>.

VIDEO
The Accumulator Pattern (revisited)
../../../VideoFiles/06.1-TheAccumulatorPattern-Part2/TheAccumulatorPattern.mp4
9:36
This video extends the accumulator pattern from the <em>summing</em> pattern that
you have seen previously
to include the <em>counting</em> and <em>in-graphics</em> accumulator patterns.

The video uses a graphics system call Zellegraphics that preceded
RoseGraphics, so you will see <em>zg</em> instead of <em>rg</em>
and other such small changes from what we use now.

VIDEO
First Do a Concrete Example By Hand
../../../VideoFiles/04.7-FirstDoAConcreteExampleByHand/FirstDoAConcreteExampleByHand.mp4
10:39
In almost ANY non-trivial software development coding problem,
you simply MUST <span class="emphasis">do a concrete example by hand,</span>
as shown in this video.

Note: The video uses the following example: Given a line, draw a diamond from the line.
The video <em>should</em> have said that the given line is the
<span class="emphasis">upper-left</span> line of the diamond.
Instead, the video wrongly spoke of "positive slope".

What is Unit Testing?

The Moodle quiz on this item also covers the next item.
So just continue to the next item to continue that Moodle quiz
when you get to questions that you think the next video will address.

This excellent explanation is taken from
<a href="http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/">Unit Testing chapter</a>
of <a href="http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/">Software Testing Fundamentals</a>.

Why Do Unit Testing?
WhyDoUnitTesting.pdf
The Moodle quiz on this item is combined with the Moodle quiz on the previous item.
That is, the Moodle quiz covers <span class="emphasis">both</span>
the previous item (<em>What is Unit Testing?</em>)
<span class="emphasis">and</span> this item (<em>Why Do Unit Testing?</em>).

This reading is from a
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1383/what-is-unit-testing/">question on StackOverflow</a>.

Stack Overflow is a TERRIFIC resource for all sorts of questions about software development and more.
You can almost always trust its answers, or at least let them point you the right direction.

Follow the above link to <span class="emphasis">read the page at the link,</span>

OPTIONAL reading: Test-First Programming was first popularized as part of

from which the above is taken.

OPTIONAL reading:
Test-First Programming (a subset of Test-Driven Programming, TDD)
is widely used in Agile Software Development Processes,
