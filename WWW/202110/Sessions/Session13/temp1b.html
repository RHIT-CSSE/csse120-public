      Each of the problems in this session has a DIFFICULTY rating and a TIME estimate.
      <span class="important_emphasis">if you reach a problem's time limit</span>
      and are not within a few minutes of completing the problem:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="important_emphasis">STOP working on that problem.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to the next problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Ask for help </strong> on the problem(s) that you did not complete.
        <ul>
          <li>
            One way to do that is via the <span class="very_important">Live Now!</span>
            channel in the <span class="important">CSSE 120</span> group in Microsoft Teams.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </aside>

  <p>
    There is no Preparation for this session.  Go straight to the PyCharm exercises
    (which are practice problems for Exam 2), in the usual way:
  </p>
  <p>
    Open PyCharm. Do:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <span class="big_code">VCS ~ Update Project</span>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    to obtain the new in-class project if it is not already in your PyCharm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reminder: The key for ALL of these practice problems is
    to <span class="important_emphasis">UNDERSTAND</span>
    the concepts behind their solutions,
    not merely to pass the tests that we provide.
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you have a solution that seems to work but you do not FULLY understand WHY it works,
        ask a student assistant or your instructor to review your solution and offer feedback.
      </li>
    </ul>
