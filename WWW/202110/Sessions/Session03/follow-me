Do NOT do this Follow-Me <em>before</em> class.  (But see note below.)

Instead, <span class="strong"> do it just before you do the </span>
<span class="emphasis">m4_calling_functions_returning_values</span> exercise
in Session 03-AccumulatorsAndFunctionsWithParameters.

That way, the material of this Follow-Me video will be fresh in your mind when you do the follow-up exercise.
But if you prefer, you can do this Follow-Me video <em>before</em> class and review it as needed
just before you do the <span class="emphasis">m4_calling_functions_returning_values</span> exercise.
