    </div>

    <div class="body">
      <p>
       You are on your honor to follow the rules specified below.
        <strong>Read them carefully.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand the importance of good grades.
        But your own self-esteem is even MORE important.
        Furthermore, if you do not do well on this exam, we will help you master the course's material
        and do better on forthcoming exams.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="emphasis">Communication:</span>
        For both parts of the exam, you must not communicate with anyone except your instructors
        and anyone explicitly allows (e.g. the other instructor).  In particular:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="critical">During</span> the exam,
          <span class="emphasis">
                you must not talk with any other student or exchange information with them during the exam.
              </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="critical">After</span> the exam,
          <span class="emphasis">you must not talk about the exam with anyone who has not yet taken it.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Throughout the exam, if you have a
            <span class="emphasis">question about WHAT we are asking you to do,</span>
            e.g. if you do not understand the specification of a function that you are to implement,
            <span class="emphasis">ask your instructor</span>
            to explain WHAT you are to do for the problem.
          <ul>
            <li>
              If your instructor is not available, skip the problem and communicate with your instructor
              in order to complete the problem later.
            </li>
            <li>
              You are on your own to determine HOW to solve the problem.
              In particular, we will not answer questions about why your code has syntax errors
              or is failing tests.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, if you do not understand WHY the expected value for a test is what we claim,
              definitely ask your instructor to clarify the problem specification.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For the <span class="emphasis">Paper-and-Pencil</span> part:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may use your computer only for the mechanics of getting, taking, and turning in the exam.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may use a Hint Sheet that is a single 8.5 x 11-inch sheet of paper, with whatever
          you want on it, typed or handwritten or a combination of the two.
          You must prepare that Hint Sheet BEFORE you begin the exam.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may use blank sheets of paper for scratch work.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may use assistive devices (e.g. devices to address dyslexia) as you would expect.
        </li>
        <li>
          The items described above are the only external resources you may use for the Paper-and-Pencil
          part of the eram.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For the <span class="emphasis">On-the-Computer</span> part:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may use anything on your computer, including your PyCharm exercises.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may use any written materials that you bring to the exam,
          including your Hint Sheet and any other notes that you have made,
          any textbook(s) that you have been using,
          and blank sheets of paper for scratch work.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may use any of the CSSE 120 materials directly reachable from our Moodle
          Course, e.g. the videos, answers to quizzes, etc.
          In particular,
          you may use the <em>Questions that students frequently wish that they could ask when
          taking Exam 1</em> from Moodle Session 6.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may NOT use the internet for anything other than the above and the mechanics
          of getting, taking, and turning in the exam.
        </li>
        <li>
          In particular, you may NOT do a Google search or anything like that.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <span class="emphasis">Time limits:</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        You take each part of the exam separately.
        For each part, you may take up to 3 hours to get, take and turn in that part of the exam.
      </p>
