          For an <span class="emphasis">online exam,</span>
          and ONLY for an online exam, you may use your computer to do any of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Enter Microsoft Teams and join in the Live (video) Meeting that starts the exam.</li>
          <li>
            Communicate with your professors (but NO ONE ELSE) via Microsoft Teams
            (and via email if Microsoft Teams is not working for you).
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Moodle to get the Pencil-and-Paper part of the exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use software on your computer to print, view, and/or type answers to
            the Paper-and-Pencil part of the exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Moodle to turn in both parts of the exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Git as usual to get and commit-and-push the On-the-Computer part of the exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use other tools like the Global Protect VPN that support the above.

              The time spent turning in your exam does NOT count toward the time limits.

                except as needed to communicate with your instructors.
                Close any such applications before beginning the exam.

            <p>
              Throughout the exam, if you have a
              <span class="emphasis">question about WHAT we are asking you to do,</span>
              e.g. if you do not understand the specification of a function that you are to implement,
              <span class="emphasis">ask ANY of the instructors</span>
              to explain WHAT you are to do for the problem.
              (If a student assistant is proctoring your room, ask them to get an instructor.)
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="emphasis">You are on your own for solving the problems.</span>

            to use the restroom, stretch your legs,
            go outside to get a break from your mask, or whatever.
            You do not need to ask permission to do so.
            But remember: <span class="emphasis"> Do NOT talk to ANYONE about ANYTHING when you do so.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Assistive devices:</span>
            You may use any assistive devices you normally use for taking
            exams, including but not limited to the following:
            <ul>
              <li> Dictionaries and/or translators.</li>
              <li> Hearing, vision and hand-writing assistive devices.</li>
              <li> Devices to address dyslexia.</li>
              <li> A calculator (but only for computing numeric values (no programming).</li>
              <li> Blank paper and/or blank post-it notes. (We'll bring some.)</li>
              <li>
                If your proctor permits it, you may listen to quiet music using
                headphones to the extent that it does not disturb other students.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">We want you to have a testing environment in which you are comfortable.</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Of course we will honor all accommodations (including extra time)
                for students that have obtained official letters stating so.
              </li>
              <li>
                Additionally,
                if you need a quieter or more secluded place to take the exam, or
                if there are other accommodations that help you be more
                effective in demonstrating your knowledge/understanding via this
                exam, do not hesitate to discuss them in advance with your
                instructor.

        </p>
        <p>
          The ONLY <span class="emphasis">external resource that you may use</span>
          beyond those listed for both parts of the exam is a
          <span class="critical">Hint Sheet,</span> as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your Hint Sheet must be a single 8.5 x 11-inch sheet of paper,
            with whatever you want on it, typed or handwritten or a combination of the two.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must have prepared your Hint Sheet before beginning the exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is best if you create your own sheet (working with someone else is fine)
            as that will probably maximize both your learning and your score on the exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            If (and ONLY if) you lack access to a printer,
            you may create an electronic document that is the equivalent of the above sheet of paper
            and you may access that document while taking the exam.
