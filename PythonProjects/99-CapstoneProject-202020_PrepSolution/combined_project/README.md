Note: You can use this folder for your project work or the individual_projects folder.

You would choose to use this folder for your project if your team wants
to make a single unified GUI (all the projects of the whole team run together
at the same time).

To use this folder decide who is student 1, student 2, etc. then you'll
always run an m0 module, but add your code to only your module.


It easiest not to rename the files, but you could do so if you like,
just make sure to update the imports in the appropriate m0 files.
