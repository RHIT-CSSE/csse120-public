"""
Capstone Team Project.  Code to run on the EV3 robot (NOT on a laptop).

This code defines the LineFollower class, for the robot's forward
facing sensor. The infrared sensor when it is in the mode does not emit light
it only looks for the light coming from the Remote Control.  The remote control
must be running in beacon mode (the top button) for this class to work.

Authors:  Your professors (for the framework) and PUT_YOUR_NAMES_HERE.
