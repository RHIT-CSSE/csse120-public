You can run this program TWICE on your OWN computer.  Or, you can run it
on your computer and get a friend to run it on their computer.

If running only on your computer, run  main1  and then run  main2.
If running on two computers, one of you should run  main1  and the other main2.

Both main1 and main2 run the exact same code, except that the name
   who_am_i
is set to 1 by main1 and to 2 by main2.  That is what causes the SAME code to
behave differently, depending on whether it was initiated from main1 or main2.

In either case (main1 or main2):
  -- The code brings up a tkinter window.
  -- The window has a filled circle on it -- blue from main1, red from main2.
  -- There are two Entry boxes and a button.
  -- The user should enter x and y coordinates (positive integers less than
       300 or so), then press the button.  This sends those coordinates
       to the other process/computer.
  -- The receiving process/computer moves its filled circle to the coordinates
       that it receives.
