"""
Example showing for tkinter and ttk how to do:
  -- A GUI including a Canvas for drqwing objects
  -- while sending and receiving messages from other computers.

For the tkinter/ttk code, see the 22-TkinterAnimation code (but ignore the
part of that code that runs the animation by using root.after).

The novel part of this example is the message-passing to/from other computers.
The key ideas are:

  1. The   mqtt_for_csse120   module defines Sender and Receiver classes
       for sending and receiving messages from other computers.
       They use MQTT as the underlying communication protocol.

  2. PyCharm will not let you run the same module twice at the same time.
       So, to test your program on your own (single) computer, you run the
       main1  module  AND the  main2  module.  The former constructs a Game
       object with who_am_i set to 1, the latter sets it to 2.
       That way, the two runs will send to each other and NOT to themselves!

       When running on two computers (with a friend running one of them),
       decide who will run  main1  and the other should run  main2.

  3. The Game object constructs a Receiver and Sender:
        receiver = communicator.Receiver(self)
        self.sender = communicator.Sender(receiver, "something_unique",
                                          who_am_i)
     where  communicator  is an abbreviation for the  mqtt_for_csse120  module.

     The "something_unique" should be any string that only YOUR programs will
     be using (so you are not communicating with random other programs).
     We suggest you use your own username as that string, e.g.
        self.sender = communicator.Sender(receiver, "alangavr", who_am_i)

  4. To send a message, just use:
        self.sender.send_message(message)  where message is any STRING.

  5. The Receiver object that the Game object constructs causes a process
       to run **in the BACKGROUND** listening for messages.  That process
       has been coded to call the specially-name method of the Game class:
           act_on_message_received

       So the Game class MUST have a method like this:
           def act_on_message_received(self, message):
              # This is called when a message comes from another computer.
              # You do whatever you want with that message.

  6. The basic structure of the code below is very similar to the structure
       from the 22-TkinterAnimation code, but with the animation part removed.
