1. Make similar files for the TouchSensor and ArmAndClaw classes, ala Lab 2.
2. Test everything.
3. Make a 99-CapstoneProject that is the real project and:
  -- Its start is identical to the Throwaway project (so students can copy
     code from the Throwaway to the real).
  -- It has similar instructions to cover the rest of Labs 1 and 2.
