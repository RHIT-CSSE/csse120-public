"""
Capstone Team Project.  Code to run on a ROBOT (NOT a laptop).

This module is for testing STAND-ALONE code running on the ROBOT
(WITHOUT having LAPTOP GUI code running on the LAPTOP at the same time).
In particular, it tests the rest of the   DriveSystem   class
(with Lab 1a having tested the previous part).

Authors:  Your professors (for the framework)
    and PUT_YOUR_NAME_HERE.
