Capstone Team Project.  Code to run on the EV3 robot (NOT on a laptop).
This is the  INDIVIDUAL  part of the project.

This code contains the one and only  MAIN  function for running on the robot.

This code constructs a robot with an associated MQTT object and runs an
infinite loop while listening for messages from the laptop and responding to
them via its "delegate" object.
