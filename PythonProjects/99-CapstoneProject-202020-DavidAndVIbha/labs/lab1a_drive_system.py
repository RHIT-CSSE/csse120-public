"""
Capstone Team Project.  Code to run on a ROBOT (NOT a laptop).

This module is for testing STAND-ALONE code running on the ROBOT
(WITHOUT having LAPTOP GUI code running on the LAPTOP at the same time).
In particular, it tests part of the   DriveSystem   class.

Authors:  Your professors (for the framework)
    and PUT_YOUR_NAME_HERE.
Winter term, 2019-2020.
