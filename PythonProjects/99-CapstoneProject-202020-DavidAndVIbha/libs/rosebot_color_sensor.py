"""
Capstone Team Project.  Code to run on the EV3 robot (NOT on a laptop).

This code defines the   ColorSensor   class, for the robot's downward-facing
sensor that repeated shines right, green and blue light and measures the
intensity of the reflections, interpreting those intensities as colors.

Authors:  Your professors (for the framework)
    and PUT_YOUR_NAMES_HERE.
