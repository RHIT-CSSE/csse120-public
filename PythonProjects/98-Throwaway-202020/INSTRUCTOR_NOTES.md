This exercise is intended to be done in part using LIVE-CODING, as follows:

Step 1: Explain the exercise to the students.

Step 2: Explain how to work in a SHARED project,
        per  HowToShareModules.pdf  herein.
        
Step 3: Students practice by implementing the  libs  modules:
  - Team members 1 and 3 pair program:
       libs/fake_robot_drive_system.
  - Team members 2 and 4 pair program:
       libs/fake_touch_sensor and
       libs/fake_arm_and_claw.
  - If a team lacks team members 3 and/or 4, do single (not pair) programming.
  
  - Step 3a:
    The instructor live-codes TODOs 1 through 3.  They are the SAME
    in each module above so both sub-teams can work at the same time.
      
  - Step 3b:
    Then the instructor live-codes TODOs 4 through 7 in
        fake_robot_drive_system
    while team members 2 and 4 watch to get the basic ideas.
      
  - Step 3c:
    Then the instructor live-codes enough of  fake_touch_sensor  and
      fake_arm_and_claw  to get students started in those modules
      (while team members 1 and 3 are working on fake_robot_drive_system).

Step 4: Students live-code the  rosebot  module, so that they understand
  the idea of accessing subsystems through a constructed RoseBot object.
  The students use ONE computer but TEAM-program (using the ENTIRE team).
  
Step 5: Students live-code the testing code, using pair-programming as before,
  but SWAPPING goals: Each sub-team tests code that the OTHER sub-team wrote
  (so that the entire team is familiar with all the methods).
