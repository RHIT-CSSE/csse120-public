"""
THROW-AWAY Capstone Project. If you mess up this THROW-AWAY project,
  ** no worries. **
It lets you practice skills & concepts needed for the REAL Capstone Project.

This module contains a   RoseBot   class that is the same as the full RoseBot
class that you will implement later, but restricted to the objects that
are relevant to this THROW-AWAY project.

Authors:  Your professors (for the framework)
    and PUT_YOUR_NAMES_HERE.
Winter term, 2019-2020.
