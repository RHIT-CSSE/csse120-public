THROW-AWAY Capstone Project. If you mess up this THROW-AWAY project,
  ** no worries. **
It lets you practice skills & concepts needed for the REAL Capstone Project.

This module contains a   DriveSystem   class that is the same as the full
DriveSystem class that you will implement later, but restricted to the methods
that are relevant to this THROW-AWAY project.

Authors:  Your professors (for the framework)
    and PUT_YOUR_NAMES_HERE.
Winter term, 2019-2020.

    #     -- Negative speeds should make the robot move backward.
    #   To "spin_in_place" means that the wheels move at speeds S and -S.

    #          (i.e., left motor goes at speed S, right motor at speed -S).

    #          (i.e., left motor goes at speed -S, right motor at speed S).
    #   To "turn" means that one wheel does not move and the other does move:
    #     -- Positive speeds should make only the left motor move
    #          (and hence the turn is clockwise).
    #     -- Negative speeds should make only the right motor move
