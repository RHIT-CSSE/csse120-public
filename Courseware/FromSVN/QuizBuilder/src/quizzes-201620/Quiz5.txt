1. Consider the following code. <img src="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse120/Images/for_quizzes/conditionals-1.png" alt="n = random.randrange(50) if ...: print('Banana')"> <p>What statement should be added in the box so the function prints Banana! only if the value of <strong>n</strong> is larger than 20? </p>
a. &nbsp;if n<20:
b. &nbsp;if n>20:~
c. &nbsp;elif n>20:
d. &nbsp;else n>20:

2. Consider the following code. <img src="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse120/Images/for_quizzes/conditionals-2.png" alt="if [box A]: print('A won') elif [box B]" print('B won') else [box C]: print('Game tied"> <p>What statements should be in boxes A, B, and C so that the sequence correctly prints either 'A won', 'B won', or 'Game tied' given scoreA (the score of player A) and scoreB (the score of player B).</p>
M. Box A -> if scoreA > scoreB:
M. Box B -> elif scoreB > scoreA:
M. Box C -> else:
M. -> elif scoreB >= scoreA:
M. -> else if scoreB > scoreA:

M. Line 1 -> def add_n(n):
M. Line 2 -> &nbsp;total = 0
M. Line 3 -> &nbsp;for i in range(n+1):
