This script (quiz_builder.py) creates Moodle xml quizzes from properly
formatted txt files. This is the "version 2" Format:

0. A slash   \   as the last character of a line is a line continuation:
   The next line is treated as if it replaced the trailing slash.
   
1. Quiz questions are separated by two (or more) empty lines.

2. Each question consists of:
  -- The statement of the question.
  -- An empty line
  -- The answer(s) to the question.

3. A question is multiple-choice by default, with each line being
   a choice, and with a tilde  ~  at the end of correct choice(s).
   
   Exception: Code blocks in an answer are always treated as if they
   were part of a single answer.
   
4. A question whose sole answer is  True   or   False is a T/F question.
5. Likewise, Yes or No indicates a Yes/No question.
6. A question with one or more answer-lines beginning  ->   is a Matching question.
7. A question that begins:  SA.
   is a Short Answer question, with answer lines be correct answers.
   If there are no answer lines, then it is an Essay question.
8. A question with no answer is a Description.

1. Each question is preceded by a number and a period (just like this line)

2. The following types of questions are supported. Each has a different format:
	a. Multiple choice
	b. True/false
	c. Short answer
	d. Matching
	e. Essay
	f. Descriptive (i.e., no question, just comment to students)
	
3. You can add any html code you want (e.g., <b>, html links).

4. If you want to include photos or figures, you can
use base64 image encoding. Simply make your image
and use a base64 image encoder to make the string
you need (one website has an image encoder here: https://www.base64-image.de/ ).
You can then put it in an img tag to make an image display in
the quiz question.
