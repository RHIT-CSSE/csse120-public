This script (quizMaker.py) creates Moodle xml quizzes from properly formatted
txt files. The necessary format is as follows:

1. Each question is preceded by a number and a period (just like this line)

2. The following types of questions are supported. Each has a different format:
	a. Multiple choice
	b. True/false
	c. Short answer
	d. Matching
	e. Essay
	f. Descriptive (i.e., no question, just comment to students)
	
3. You can add any html code you want (e.g., <b>, html links).

4. If you want to include photos or figures, you can
use base64 image encoding. Simply make your image
and use a base64 image encoder to make the string
you need (one website has an image encoder here: https://www.base64-image.de/ ).
You can then put it in an img tag to make an image display in
the quiz question.
