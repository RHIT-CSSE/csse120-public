D. Part 1 

Comment
String
Function
Call a function by:

Which of the following are Python **comments** [Multi-checkboxes.]
 - Authors: Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde.
 - 'Date written: March 5, 2016'
 - print('This program prints "Hello, World"')
 - # This program prints
   #  Hello, World
   # on the Console.
 - # TODO: Write a program that makes people laugh.

Which of the following are STRINGS?
 - Once upon a time...
 - "Once upon a time..."
 - 'Once upon a time...'
 - # Once upon a time...
 - 'a'
 - ""

What appears on the console when the following statement runs?
(If nothing, leave the answer box empty.)
   # print('one')

Ditto:
   print('two')

Ditto:
   print(2 + 2)
Ditto:
   print('2 + 2')
Ditto:
   print(4, 9)
Ditto:
   print('4, 9')

Suppose that a program has defined a function
whose name is write_to_file that takes
a single string and writes the string to a file.
Which of the following is the correct notation
for CALLING that function?  Multi-checkboxes.
 - write_to_file('Robots rule!')
 - write_to_file 'Robots rule!'
 - Write_to_file('Robots rule!')

Ditto, but:
whose name is insult that takes no argument
and prints a randomly chosen insult.
 - insult
 - insult()


Part II

Each session, in class you:
 - Sleep.
 - Sing a bawdy song.
 - Dance a jig.
 - Check out the project for the session and go through
   the modules whose name begins with an "m",
   in the order that they are numbered.

Which of the following modules is an EXAMPLE module? mcheck
 - m3e_loops.py
 - m1_intro.py
 - m6_example1.py
 - m6e_example2.py
 
 When you do an EXAMPLE module, you should:
  - Study the module for at least 10 minutes.
  - Skip the module and come back to it later as needed.
  - Run the module (so you know what it does)
    and at least skim the code (so that you know what examples it has).
    
 When you do a module that is NOT an example module, you should:
   - Growl like a bear.
   - Ctow like a rooster.
   - Do whatever the TODOs in the module tell you to do.
   
 In this course, the instructions for what to do in class are:
   - Handed out on paper at the beginning of class.
   - In a file reachable from the session's Preparation page.
   - In each non-example module itself, at the TODOs in the module.
   
 In this course, you turn in your in-class work by COMMITTING the
 modules that you modify.  You should commit (i.e,. turn in your work)
   = Once in a blue moon.
   - As often as you want, but at least as you complete each module
     and (if you are in the middle of a module) at the end of the session.
     
 Part III
 
 Assuming that your Python setup includes a module whose name is
 <em>random</em> (it does), the following statement in a module
 allows that module to access all the things defined at the top level
 inside the <em>random</em> module.
   import random
 True
 False
 
 When the code reaches the first statement in the following snippet
 of code, in what order will the four statements be run?
  = Top to bottom (that is, ...)
  - The assignments (lines XX and XX) go first, then the other two statements.
  - You can't tell from this snippet alone.
 
  
   bunny.hop(3)
   alpha.go_first()
   x = 3
   nadia = rg.SimpleTurtle()
 
 
 Which of the following makes the name crow have the value 'black'.
  - crow = 'black'
  - 'black' = crow
  - black = 'crow'
  - 'crow' = black
  
  To CONSTRUCT a SimpleTurtle, like this,
    rg.SimpleTurtle()
  and then to set that SimpleTurtle to a name, like this:
    turtle1 = rg.SimpleTurtle()
  does which of the following? cbox
   - allocates space for an object that will have data
     of the sort that SimpleTurtles can have
   - makes  turtle1  refer to that space
   
   The statement
      akil.left(90)
   causes the program to do the following three things,
   but NOT in the order listed here:
   1. Do whatever the code in the left method says to do.
   2. Goes to the code in the left method,
   sending it the number 45 and the object to which the name akil refers.
   3. Returns from the left method to the place where the left method
      was called, and continues 
   2. Sends the  the following in what order:
   1. Goes to the LEFT method, sending it the number 90.
   2. Does whatever the code in the LEFT method says to do.
   to allocate space for an object
  that will contain data.
   Which of the following statements constructs a TurtleWindow?
 
 Which CALLS a METHOD.
 Which references the INSTANCE VARIABLE
The following statement CALLs the   - go to the function, sending it the information
  - True
  - False
  
  
 in the <em>random</em> module (assuming that there is such a module
 in your Python system, as there is in fact)
 
 Which of these is a METHOD, and which is an INSTANCE VARiBLE:
 
 If you get an error messages in Session 1,
 you should check for a simple typographical error (perhaps a misspelling)
 and then:
 1. Keep working on the problem until you fix the error.
 2. Ask a knowledge classmate, your instructor, or a student assistant for help.
 3. Go home.
 4. Scream.
