(Nothing to turn in for this problem: just leave its answer box blank.)

D. The previous problem asked you to draw a box-and-pointer diagram for the following: <pre> y = 7 <br> y = y * 3 </pre> Here is a correct answer: <blockquote> <img src="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse120/Images/for_quizzes/box-and-pointer-rule-4b.png"> </blockquote> <strong>Compare your answer (that you wrote on scratch paper) to the above.</strong>  Be sure that they are the same (and if not, bring any questions that you have about them to class).

18. Consider the code snippet: <pre> x = 10 <br> y = x * 2 <br> p = rg.Point(x, y) <br> x = 40 <br> p.y = 30 </pre> The box-and-pointer diagram after the FIRST THREE lines execute is as follows: <blockquote> <img src="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse120/Images/for_quizzes/box-and-pointer-rule-4c.png"> </blockquote> On a piece of scratch paper (NOT here in this Moodle quiz), re-draw the above diagram and then augment your diagram to show the effect of the last two lines of code shown above.

D. The previous problem asked you to draw a box-and-pointer diagram for the following: <pre> x = 10 <br> y = x * 2 <br> p = rg.Point(x, y) <br> x = 40 <br> p.y = 30 </pre> Here is a correct answer. <blockquote> <img src="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse120/Images/for_quizzes/box-and-pointer-rule-4d.png"> </blockquote> <strong>Compare your answer (that you wrote on scratch paper) to the above.</strong>  Be sure that they are the same (and if not, bring any questions that you have about them to class).
 
19. Consider the code snippet: <pre> number1 = 88 <br> number2 = number1 </pre> Explain what is WRONG about the following attempt at a box-and-pointer diagram for the above code snippet: <blockquote> <img src="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse120/Images/for_quizzes/box-and-pointer-variables-never-point-to-variables.png">

20. Consider the code snippet: <pre> r = 66 <br> r2 = r <br> center = rg.Point(90, 40) <br> circle = rg.Circle(center, r) <br> r = 35 <br> center.x = 200 <br> <br> print(r) <br> print(r2) <br> print(center) </br> print(circle) </pre> Determine IN YOUR HEAD (that is, without using a computer and without using any scratch paper) what would be printed when the above code snippet executes.  In the box below, write your answer for what would be printed. (The details of how you write the center and circle are unimportant; any way is fine.  Just don't use any VARIABLES in your answer.  That is, use only NUMBERS and the class names rg.Circle and rg.Point.)

21. On a piece of scratch paper (NOT here in this Moodle quiz), draw a box and pointer diagram for the FIRST FOUR lines of the code snippet in the previous problem. (Nothing to turn in for this problem: just leave its answer box blank.)

D. The previous problem asked you to draw a box-and-pointer diagram for the FIRST FOUR lines of the following six-line code snippet: <pre> r = 66 <br> r2 = r <br> center = rg.Point(90, 40) <br> circle = rg.Circle(center, r) <br> r = 35 <br> center.x = 200 </pre> Here is a correct answer to the previous problem: <blockquote> <img src="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse120/Images/for_quizzes/box-and-pointer-summary-a.png"> </blockquote> <strong>Compare your answer (that you wrote on scratch paper) to the above.</strong>  Be sure that they are the same (and if not, bring any questions that you have about them to class).

22. Agument your box-and-pointer diagram for the previous problem to include the remaining two lines of its code snippet. (Nothing to turn in for this problem: just leave its answer box blank.)

D. The previous problem asked you to draw a box-and-pointer diagram for the first six lines of the following code snippet: <pre> r = 66 <br> r2 = r <br> center = rg.Point(90, 40) <br> circle = rg.Circle(center, r) <br> r = 35 <br> center.x = 200 <br> <br> print(r) <br> print(r2) <br> print(center) </br> print(circle) </pre> Here is a correct answer to the previous problem: <blockquote> <img src="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse120/Images/for_quizzes/box-and-pointer-summary-b.png"> </blockquote> <strong>Compare your answer (that you wrote on scratch paper) to the above.</strong>  Be sure that they are the same (and if not, bring any questions that you have about them to class).

23. Now that you have a box-and-pointer diagram for the above code snippet, consider again: What what would be printed when the above code snippet executes?  In the box below, write your answer for what would be printed. <strong> Compare your answer to THIS problem to what you wrote for a PREVIOUS problem (three problems back) that asked the same question.</strong>  Are the two answers the same?  If they are NOT the same, and you are uncertain which is correct, <strong> bring any questions that you have to class.</strong>
