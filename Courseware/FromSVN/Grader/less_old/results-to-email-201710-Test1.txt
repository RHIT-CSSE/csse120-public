Hi!  Here is your score on Test 1, along with comments on your work.

IMPORTANT: Please examine the places below (if any) where there is either
  -- a line that has an indication of points deducted (and why)
  -- a line that begins with 'See me ...'
The 'See me ...' lines are comments that are important for you to
understand, even though no points were deducted for them on THIS test.

For the in-class portion of Test 1, your score on each problem is
on Moodle.  For problems where you missed points, re-try the problem.
Then, in class show me your reworked result and I will tell you
whether or not it is correct.  That way, you can learn from your mistakes!

The following lines are brief, hence somewhat cryptic.  Simply
   ** BRING YOUR QUESTIONS TO CLASS. **

Hi!  Here is your score on Test 1, along with comments on your work.

IMPORTANT: Please examine the places below (if any) where there is either
  -- a line that has an indication of points deducted (and why)
  -- a line that begins with 'See me ...'
The 'See me ...' lines are comments that are important for you to
understand, even though no points were deducted for them on THIS test.

For the in-class portion of Test 1, your score on each problem is
on Moodle.  For problems where you missed points, re-try the problem.
Then, in class show me your reworked result and I will tell you
whether or not it is correct.  That way, you can learn from your mistakes!

The following lines are brief, hence somewhat cryptic.  Simply
   ** BRING YOUR QUESTIONS TO CLASS. **

Hi!  Here is your score on Test 1, along with comments on your work.

IMPORTANT: Please examine the places below (if any) where there is either
  -- a line that has an indication of points deducted (and why)
  -- a line that begins with 'See me ...'
The 'See me ...' lines are comments that are important for you to
understand, even though no points were deducted for them on THIS test.

For the in-class portion of Test 1, your score on each problem is
on Moodle.  For problems where you missed points, re-try the problem.
Then, in class show me your reworked result and I will tell you
whether or not it is correct.  That way, you can learn from your mistakes!

The following lines are brief, hence somewhat cryptic.  Simply
   ** BRING YOUR QUESTIONS TO CLASS. **

on Moodle.  For problems where you missed points, re-try the problem.
Then, in class show me your reworked result and I will tell you
whether or not it is correct.  That way, you can learn from your mistakes!
